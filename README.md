#I will be starting a class this semester learning Python coding language.  Experience my journey!
# I have not started this class yet.  It starts in 9 days, however, I am using the SoloLearn app on my phone to explore for now!




#This will be the start of famous "hello world!"

print('Hello world!')

#That is it for Python!  Simple enough!
